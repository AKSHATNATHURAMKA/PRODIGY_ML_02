Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on customer segmentation using K-means clustering, developed during my internship at Prodify Infotech. The primary goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant attributes, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to understand their customer base better and tailor their services to meet the needs of different customer groups. This project employs the K-means clustering algorithm to classify customers into distinct segments based on various features.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and key insights through visualizations.
K-Means Clustering: Implementing the K-means algorithm to identify optimal customer segments.
Cluster Analysis: Evaluating the quality and characteristics of the formed clusters.
Visualization: Presenting the clusters using various plots for better interpretability.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
